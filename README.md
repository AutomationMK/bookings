# Bookings Web Application

## Description

This is a simple web application for handling hotel bookings
A go backend is used and is inspired by following along
tsawler's go web applications udemy course. His own repository
can be found at https://github.com/tsalwer/bookings-app

This project is mostly focused on showcasing the golang 
backend features including the following backend methods...
* Creation and handling of the http routing 
* Creation and implementation of Middleware for routes
* Serving static files to the website
* Implementing a template rendering function for go tmpl files
* Integrating javascript and css to be served as static files
* Writing tests for all backend functions
* Connecting to a Postgress database to persist user data
* Implementing sending mail notifications
* Authenticating users and setting up an Admin user

Anywhere along the way I implemented any personal changes on
my end based on my own knowledge of web design. Such as
using tailwindcss for generating the styles of the website.
